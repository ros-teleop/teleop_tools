1.2.1 (2020-10-29)
------------------

1.2.0 (2020-10-16)
------------------
* Change the file mode of the python files in joy_teleop.
  They don't need to be executable.
* Add in Python typing to joy_teleop.
  This also showed a few bugs.
* Add a test for service becoming ready.
* Add in tests for parameter failures.
* Add a test for debouncing.
  The test works by having a subscription to the output topic.
  Every time the subscription is received, we increment a counter.
  There is also a timer callback that executes every 0.1 seconds,
  publishing the 'joy' message.  Like other tests, this publication
  toggles the button on and off to avoid debouncing.  Unlike other
  tests, once we have seen one message come in, we stop toggling
  and just set it to one all of the time to ensure debouncing
  works properly.
* Add in a test for actions.
* Add in tests for services.
* Add a test for topic axis mappings.
* Add in a test for a simple message.
* Add in joy_teleop common testing tools.
  These will be used by the rest of the tests.
* Add in unit tests for get_interface_type.
* Rename test_pop257 -> test_pep257.
* Rewrite to use classes instead of maps.
  This has a number of benefits:
  1.  I think it is much easier to read; the classes only implement
  the pieces they are concerned with.
  2.  Actions and services now automatically reconnect as action
  servers or service servers come and go.
  3.  It is easier to write tests for individual functionality.
  The API to this node stays the same; the parameters and topics
  that were used before are still honored.
* Raise errors when parsing configuration fails.
  This lets the user know that their configuration is wrong
  much earlier.
* Get rid of self.config.
  We never use it outside of the constructor, so just make it
  a local variable.
* Rename al_clients -> action_clients.
* Contributors: Chris Lalancette

1.1.0 (2020-04-21)
------------------
* Add the ability to have deadman axes. (`#46 <https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_tools/issues/46>`_)
  * Add the ability to have deadman axes.
  Some controllers don't have a convenient shoulder trigger
  button, but do have shoulder "axes".  Allow the axes to
  be used for a deadman trigger, assuming they are pressed
  all the way.  Note that I used a dict for the list of
  axes, as this provides the most convenient way to deal
  with controllers that use 1.0, -1.0, or 0.0 as the "far"
  end of the axis.
  * Make sure to ignore buttons and axes that don't exist.
* Contributors: Chris Lalancette

  - match_command() now compares button array length to the max
  deadman button index (apples to apples)
  - match_command function now checks if any of the deadman buttons
  are depressed before returning a match
  - properly handle a std_msgs/msg/Empty 'message_value' by not
  attempting to access its value
  - utilizes iter-items to correctly index into the config dict
  for 'axis_mappings''s 'axis' and 'button' values
  - set_member() now splits according to a dash (-) rather than a
  periond (.) to be consistent with ros2 param parsing & example yaml
  - adds the correct name to setup.py for test_key_teleop.py test
